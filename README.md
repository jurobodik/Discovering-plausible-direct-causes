Welcome to the supplementary package of the manuscript 'Identifiability of direct causes of a target variable'

-In the script called 'Main functions' is the code for the function that estimates F-plausbile, F-identifiable parents of a target variable together with a score-based algorithm

-In the script called 'Random_multivariate_functions_and_benchmarks' is the code for generating the benchmark datasets and generating a random d-dimensional function using the Perlin noise approach

-In the 'Simulations' folder you can find scripts to recreate all results presented in the manuscript. They are not extremly well commented, but I hope they are understandable

Enjoy! If you find a mistake write to juraj.bodik@unil.ch
