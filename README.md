# Structural Restrictions in Local Causal Discovery: Identifying Direct Causes of a Target Variable

Welcome to the supplementary package for the manuscript "Structural Restrictions in Local Causal Discovery: Identifying Direct Causes of a Target Variable"! This repository contains all the code and data needed to replicate the results presented in the paper.

## Contents

### Main Functions
The `Main functions` script includes the code for:
1. Estimating F-plausible and F-identifiable parents of a target variable using the IDS algorithm.
2. A score-based algorithm for estimating parents of the target variable Y.
   
### Random Multivariate Functions and Benchmarks
The `Random_multivariate_functions_and_benchmarks` script provides the code for:
- Generating benchmark datasets.
- Creating random d-dimensional functions using the Perlin noise approach.

### Simulations
The `Simulations` folder contains scripts that can be used to recreate all the results presented in the manuscript. While these scripts may not be extensively commented, they should still be comprehensible.

## Usage

1. **Main Functions**: Use this script to estimate the causal parents of your target variable.
2. **Random Multivariate Functions and Benchmarks**: Generate benchmark datasets and random functions for testing.
3. **Simulations**: Run these scripts to reproduce the results from the manuscript.
